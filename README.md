# full_MIPS_processor_in_VHDL
Step-by-step development of a 5-stage in-order MIPS processor with exceptions, branch predictor, memory hierarchy, performance counters and store-buffer in VHDL.
Tested in simulator using matrix multiplication benchmark and so.

Final design in full_MIPS_processor_in_VHDL/Pry2/fumanal_garcia
